## Tumour dormancy in breast cancer: an update Muriel Brackstone,corresponding author1,2,3 Jason L Townson,1,4 and Ann F Chambers1,3,4

Demicheli and colleagues demonstrated that plotting the hazard rate (or conditional probability of outcome) from time of surgery to death revealed a peak incidence of death at 1 to 2 years and again at 5 years (60 months) [7,9-11]. These studies have led to speculation that this peak in death at five years likely represents the awakening of dormant tumour cells unaffected by adjuvant regional or systemic treatment [6-11].

In Figure â€‹Figure1,1, use of cytotoxic chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF)) post-mastectomy was shown to result in a dampening of the first, early peak of recurrences, with little effect on later recurrences, suggesting that this chemotherapy, while improving survival for the group, was having minimal effect on the development of late recurrences, seen to peak at five years post-treatment. The theory of tumour dormancy, rather than steady re-growth of remaining cancer in these patients, is supported by growth kinetic theory utilizing mathematical models to estimate residual tumour cell doubling times [5], because recurrences were found to develop considerably later than would be expected based on growth kinetics alone.
