USS info there are 
    109 biopsies
    40 patients

Clinical sheet there are 
    42 patients

Georgeset has
    170 samples total, including replicates and UHRR    
    68 FF; 102 FFPE -> final de-replicated version is 68 vs. 58
    43 patients (excluding UHRR)
        25 are dormant, 10 desensitised and 8 NA
    125 unique samples (excluding UHRR)



Cigdem's sample sheet has
    44 unique patients (this matches)


Samples that are material reps but not listed on Cigdem's sheet are (from pheno-materia-replicates.csv)
    268-4
    298-4
    347-1/2/4
    413-4

I'm pretty sure 251-1/2/4-1a/1b FFPE should be 215 (or should some 215s be 251s???)
208-4-a/b was incorrectly labelled 208-3-a/b

68 samples (24 patients) overlap between georgetown and edinburgh, so what can georgeset add to edset?
    57 additional samples (37 dormant, 6 desensitised, 14 NA)
    24 patients (16 dormant, 4 desensitised, 4 NA)

Combined data
    234 samples (150 dormant, 68 desensitised, 17 NA)
    81 patients


Questions:
    Is 30 days difference between final uss and final biopsy enough?
        We give 120 days for the initial drop afterall
